My first Project Recipes

- This will be my first challenge, to build a recipe page starting with the first step: the structure of the page

- I had fun building the structure of this simple recipe page.

- With this project I have a basic notion of HTML
- I learned to give structure and hierarchy to the content, it will help me in future pages.
- I learned to add images to my web page
- Learn to use ordered and unordered lists

(CSS coming soon)
